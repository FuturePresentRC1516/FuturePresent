# FuturePresent

This is a project for 'Reti di Calcolatori' course (2015/16).

To run FuturePresent on your own computer you first need to register the application on [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) and on [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
Once you got secret keys, put them in the file "keys.js".
Then install [Docker](https://docker.com) and, in a terminal, 'docker-compose' (apt-get install docker-compose).

Now in terminal, in FuturePresent's folder run the command: docker-compose up.

API's documentation is in 'api.txt'.

Enjoy!
