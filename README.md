# FuturePresent

This is a project for 'Reti di Calcolatori' course (2015/16).

To run FuturePresent on your own computer you first need to register the application on [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) (you need a Facebook account) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
Once you got the secret keys, put them in the file "keys.json".
Then install [Docker](https://docker.com) and 'docker-compose' (apt-get install docker-compose).

Now in terminal, in FuturePresent's folder run the command: docker-compose up.

API's documentation is [here!](https://github.com/FuturePresentRC1516/FuturePresent/wiki/APIs).

Enjoy!
